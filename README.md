# Ramanujan numbers â€“ an exercise in laziness

## Definition

Ramanujan numbers, also called Hardy-Ramanujan numbers or Taxicab
were born in an anecdote:

> When Ramanujan heard that Hardy had come in a taxi he asked him what
> the number of the taxi was. Hardy said that it was just a boring
> number: 1729. Ramanujan replied that 1729 was not a boring number at
> all: it was a very interesting one. He explained that it was the
> smallest number that could be expressed by the sum of two cubes in
> two different ways.
